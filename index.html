<div>Last Will and Testament</div>
<div>of</div>
<div> <span class="Name">  name</span></div>
<p> I, <span class="Name"> name</span>, residing in <span class="cityName">  name</span>, County of <span class="countyName">  Name</span> and State of New York, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, revoking any and all prior Wills and Codicils made by me.</p>
<div>ARTICLE ONE</div>
<p>
I give and bequeath all tangible personal property owned by me at the time of my death, including, but not limited to furniture, furnishings, rugs, pictures, books, silver, linen, china, glassware, objects of art, wearing apparel, jewelry, boats and automobiles, together with all policies of insurance relating thereto to my children who survive me, to be divided among them in as nearly equal shares as they may agree upon or, if they are unable to reach such an agreement, as my Executrix shall determine, provided that any of such property that my Executrix may deem unsuitable for distribution shall be sold or otherwise disposed of and the proceeds thereof shall be added to my residuary estate.
I direct that the expense of packing, shipping, insuring and delivering any of my tangible personal property to any legatee shall be paid as an administrative expense of my estate.
</p>
<div>ARTICLE TWO</div>
<p>
I give and devise any interest which I own at the time of my death in the house and lot located at 11 McKinley Avenue, Lynbrook, New York as follows:
A 50% interest to my daughter DENISE D’ANTONIO, if she survives me.  If she shall not survive me to her children per stirpes;
A 50% interest to my daughter LISA TAFURI, if she survives me.  If she shall not survive me to her children per stirpes.
</p>
<div>ARTICLE THREE</div>
<p>
All of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, wherever situated, including any lapsed or ineffective legacies or devises (but excluding any property over which I may have a power of appointment, it being my intention not to exercise any such power), herein sometimes referred to as my “residuary estate”, I give, devise and bequeath my residuary estate to my children per stirpes.
</p>
<div>
ARTICLE FOUR
</div>
<p>
A.	I direct my Executrix to pay the expenses of my funeral and of the administration of my estate as soon after my death as shall be practicable, and to pay from my residuary estate, without apportionment, all estate, transfer or death taxes imposed upon my estate, with respect to property passing under this Will.  All such taxes in respect of other property shall be apportioned against, and paid by, the persons in possession thereof or benefited thereby, in the manner provided by law.
</p>
<p>
B.	I direct that all my debts be paid as soon as practicable after my death, except that I give my Executrix the discretion of paying off any mortgage which I may have on real property owned by me and used as my residence at the time of my death.
</p>
<p>
C.	I authorize my Executrix, in her sole and absolute discretion, to use administration expenses as deductions for estate tax purposes or income tax purposes and to use date of death values or optional values for estate tax purposes, regardless of the effect thereof on any interests under this Will, and I direct that there shall be no adjustment of such interests by reason of any action taken by my Executrix pursuant hereto.
</p>

<div> ARTICLE FIVE </div>
<p>
If any beneficiary under this Will and I shall die simulta¬neously or in such circumstances as to render it difficult or impossible to determine who prede¬ceased the other, it shall conclusively be presumed for the purposes of this Will that I survived.  If any person whose life measures the duration of a trust hereunder and any remainderman of such trust shall die under such circumstances that there is reasonable doubt as to who died first, I direct that such person whose life measures the duration of such trust shall be conclusively deemed to have survived such remainderman.
</p>
<div>ARTICLE SIX</div>
<p>
D.	I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my daughter, LISA TAFURI, to be the Executrix of this my Last Will and Testament.  If LISA TAFURI should fail to qualify or cease to act as Executrix, for any reason, then I appoint my daughter, DENISE D’ANTONIO, as Executrix in her place.
</p>

<p>
E.	The individuals named in the foregoing paragraph are granted the continuing discretionary power, exercisable while in office, and exercisable only unanimously if more than one of them is then in office, to designate one or more successors or a succession of successors in such office to act one at a time or together with co-fiduciaries, to fill any vacancy occurring in such office after any successor designated herein shall have failed to qualify or ceased to act, by written instrument, duly acknowledged, and to revoke any such designation prior to the happening of the event upon which it is to become effective, by a written instrument, duly acknowledged, and a new designation may be made as above provided.  If there shall be more than one such designation of successor executrix or trustee in effect and unrevoked, they shall be effective in the reverse of the order in which they were made.
</p>
<p>
Any fiduciary may resign at any time by delivering or mailing a notice in writing of such resignation to his or her co-fiduciaries, or, if none, to his or her designated successor, if such designee has indicated his or her willingness to act, and thirty days thereafter such resignation shall take effect.  If any fiduciary becomes disabled, that determination of disability shall also constitute that individual’s immediate resignation as a fiduciary without any further act.  For the purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be considered disabled if either:
</p>
<p>
1.	A committee, guardian, conservator or similar fiduciary shall have been appointed for such person; or
</p>
<p>
2.	A court shall have determined, or two physicians shall have certified, that the person is incompetent or otherwise unable to act prudently and effectively in financial affairs.
</p>
<p>
Each successor executrix and successor trustee shall have all rights and discretions which are granted to the Executrix and trustee who preceded that successor, except those which may be specifically denied in this Will.
</p>
<p>
At any time that there are two or more executors or trustees then in office all decisions regarding my estate or trust hereunder shall be made by both or the majority of my fiduciaries in such office.  However, my fiduciaries may from time to time authorize one of their number, or each of them acting singly, to execute instruments of any kind on their behalf (including, but not by way of limitation, any check, order, demand, assignment, transfer, contract, authorization, proxy, consent, notice or waiver).  Insofar as third parties dealing with my fiduciaries are concerned instruments executed and acts performed by one fiduciary pursuant to such authorization shall be fully binding as if executed or performed by all of them.  An authorization shall be valid until those acting in reliance on it receive actual notice of its revocation.
</p>
<p>
No individual who is both a trustee and a beneficiary of any trust hereunder shall participate in the exercise of any power to make discretionary distributions of principal or income to himself or herself or in discharge of a legal obligation of support which such person has or to make discretionary allocations of receipts or expenses as between principal and income in his or her own favor.
</p>
<p>
No fiduciary shall be required to give any bond or other security for the faithful performance of such fiduciary’s duties in any jurisdiction whatsoever; or if any such bond shall be required, no such fiduciary shall be required to furnish any surety thereon.  No Executrix shall be required to file a bond to secure the return of any payment or payments on account of commissions of such Executrix.
</p>
<p>
Trustee commissions shall be those trustee commissions allowable under New York Law from time to time during the period of the administration of the trust.
Any corporate executrix serving hereunder shall receive compensation in accor¬dance with its Schedule of Fees in effect from time to time during the period over which its services are performed.  All compensation shall be charged against principal or income, or partly against both, as my Executrix and Trustee may deem appropriate.
</p>
<p>
No successor trustee shall have any responsibility for the acts or omissions of any prior trustee, and no duty to audit or investigate the accounts or administration of any such trustee, nor, unless in writing requested to do so by a person having a present or future beneficial interest under a trust, any duty to take any action to obtain redress for breach of trust.
</p>
<div>ARTICLE SEVEN</div>
<p>
F.	Whenever “child”, “children” or “issue” appears in this Will, it shall be deemed to include only lawful natural issue and persons deriving their relationship to or through their parent or ancestor by legal adoption prior to such adopted person’s attainment of the age of sixteen (16) years.  The Testator’s now living children are DENISE D’ANTONIO, LISA TAFURI, and ROSEANN HENNESSEY, and DOMINICK ANASTASIO.
</p>
<p>
G.	A disposition in this Will to the descendants of a person per stirpes shall be deemed to require a division into a sufficient number of equal shares to make one share for each child of such person living at the time such disposition becomes effective and one share for each then deceased child of such person having one or more descendants then living, regardless of whether any child of such person is then living, with the same principle to be applied in any required further division of a share at a more remote generation.
</p>
<p>
H.	Any reference to the “Code” shall be a reference to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any Regulations promulgated from time to time thereunder, or any corresponding provisions of any successor statute thereto or Regulations thereunder.
</p>

<div>ARTICLE EIGHT</div>
<p>
I.	All references herein to this Will shall be construed as referring to this Will and any codicil or codicils hereto that I may hereafter execute.
</p>
<p>
J.	Wherever necessary or appropriate, the use herein of any gender shall be deemed to include the other genders and the use herein of either the singular or the plural shall be deemed to include the other.
</p>
<p>
K.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Will:
</p>
<p>
1.	Each reference to my “fiduciaries” shall be deemed to mean and refer to my Executrix and to my Trustee and, where applicable, to a guardian hereunder;
</p>
<p>
2.	Each reference to my “Executrix” or to my “Trustee” shall be deemed to mean and refer to the fiduciary or fiduciaries, natural or corporate, who shall be acting hereunder in such capacity from time to time; and
</p>
<p>
3.	Any and all power, authority and discretion conferred upon my Executrix, my Trustee or my fiduciaries may be exercised by the fiduciary or fiduciaries who shall qualify and be acting hereunder from time to time in the capacity in which such power, authority and discretion are exercised.
</p>
<p>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I sign, seal, publish and declare this instrument to be my Last Will and Testament this February ___, 2015.
